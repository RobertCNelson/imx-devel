This just a simple set of scripts to rebuild a known working kernel for omap devices..

Script Bugs: "bugs@rcn-ee.com"

Supported Boards:

Weakly Support Boards:

Dependencies: GCC ARM Cross ToolChain

Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi

Linaro:
http://www.linaro.org/downloads/

Angstrom:

Dependencies: Linux Kernel Source

This script, pulls the mainline kernel source from git.. Using git, you can clone the linux-stable git tree from kernel.org anywhere. (it's a large download)..

For example: in your user directory:
cd ~/
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
Then update "LINUX_GIT" to "LINUX_GIT=~/" in system.sh

Build: zImage/Modules:

"./build_kernel.sh"

Install to SD card: zImage/Modules:

"./tools/load_uImage.sh"

Build: Debian deb package:

"./build_deb.sh"

Hacking: Made some some changes but don't want to rebuild the whole tree:

zImage/Modules:
"./tools/rebuild.sh"

Deb:
"./tools/rebuild_deb.sh"
