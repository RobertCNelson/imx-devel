Subject: [PATCH 109/231] ENGR00251630 MX6DQ: do not power off ARM in suspend
 on TO1.1

System will resume back failed which caused by IPG clock glich issue. The issue
(TKT094231) has been fixed on MX6DQ TO1.2 and MX6DL TO1.1.It is hard to
reproduced on MX6DQ TO1.1/1.0 with 0xffffffff in GPC_PGC_CPU_PUPSCR
which implemented on GA release. But it is easy to reproduced with 0xf0f0 on
mainline now. As we focus on latest formal chip, the problem is cleaned up until
now. We will aign with the workaround on MX6DL which do not power off ARM in
suspend.
