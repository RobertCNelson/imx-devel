Subject: [PATCH 950/998] PM / Runtime: Fix pm_runtime_suspended()

There are some situations (e.g. in __pm_generic_call()), where
pm_runtime_suspended() is used to decide whether or not to execute
a device's (system) ->suspend() callback.  The callback is not
executed if pm_runtime_suspended() returns true, but it does so
for devices that don't even support runtime PM, because the
power.disable_depth device field is ignored by it.  This leads to
problems (i.e. devices are not suspened when they should), so rework
pm_runtime_suspended() so that it returns false if the device's
power.disable_depth field is different from zero.
